# Steps to Scaffold a Simple FastAPI Application with Health Endpoint

Here are the steps I would take to scaffold a simple FastAPI application with a health endpoint, following best practices and the recommended folder structure from the FastAPI documentation:

1. **Create the basic folder structure**:
   ```
   app/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── main.py
   ├── routers/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── health.py
   └── core/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── config.py
   ```

2. **Set up the core configuration module** (`app/core/config.py`):
   - Define application settings
   - Set up environment variables handling
   - Configure logging

3. **Create the health router** (`app/routers/health.py`):
   - Import APIRouter from FastAPI
   - Define a health endpoint that returns status information
   - Include proper typing and status codes
   - Add informative docstrings

4. **Implement the main application** (`app/main.py`):
   - Import and configure the FastAPI application
   - Include the health router
   - Add application metadata (title, description, version)
   - Set up any global middleware or dependencies

5. **Create entry point** (`main.py` in the root directory):
   - Import the FastAPI app
   - Configure server settings for running the application
   - Add a conditional for running the app directly with `uv run`

6. **Set up dependency management with uv**:
   - Initialize the project with `uv init --app` to create a `pyproject.toml`
   - Add FastAPI dependencies using `uv add fastapi --extra standard`
   - Define Python version requirements (e.g., requires-python = ">=3.12")
   - Add additional development dependencies with `uv add --dev pytest httpx pytest-mock`
   - Use `uv.lock` for reproducible dependency resolution
   - Configure .gitignore file
   - Create README.md with setup and usage instructions

7. **Set up testing structure**:
   - Create a tests directory
   - Add basic health endpoint tests
   - Leverage pytest fixtures for common test setups:
     - Create a `conftest.py` with client fixture for FastAPI TestClient
     - Use fixtures for mocking dependencies and services
     - Implement session-scoped fixtures for expensive operations
   - Structure tests to match the application structure

8. **Add Docker configuration**:
   - Create a Dockerfile that uses `uv` for dependency management:
     - Start from Python base image (e.g., `python:3.12-slim`)
     - Copy uv from the official image (`COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/`)
     - Use `uv sync --frozen --no-cache` for reproducible builds
     - Configure the container to run the FastAPI app
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development

This approach follows the recommended FastAPI project structure with proper separation of concerns, making the application maintainable and scalable. The health endpoint serves as a simple way to verify the API is running correctly. Using `uv` for Python and dependency management provides faster installation times, more reliable dependency resolution, and a consistent development environment across all platforms.

## Running the Application with uv

To run the FastAPI application using `uv`:

1. **Initialize the project**:
   ```bash
   uv init --app
   ```

2. **Add FastAPI dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv add fastapi --extra standard
   ```

3. **For development, add testing dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv add --dev pytest httpx pytest-mock
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   uv run -m uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
   Or with the FastAPI CLI if installed:
   ```bash
   uv run fastapi dev
   ```

5. **For testing**:
   ```bash
   uv run -m pytest
   ```
   
   To run tests with coverage reporting:
   ```bash
   uv run -m pytest --cov=app tests/ --cov-report term-missing
   ```
   
   For test discovery, pytest will automatically find tests that follow these patterns:
   - Files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
   - Functions prefixed with `test_`
   - Classes prefixed with `Test`
   
   Example test structure:
   ```python
   # tests/conftest.py
   import pytest
   from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
   from app.main import app

   @pytest.fixture
   def client():
       """Fixture providing a FastAPI TestClient."""
       return TestClient(app)
       
   # tests/test_health.py
   def test_health_endpoint(client):
       """Test that the health endpoint returns the expected status."""
       response = client.get("/health")
       assert response.status_code == 200
       assert "status" in response.json()
       assert response.json()["status"] == "ok"
   ```

Your `pyproject.toml` should look similar to this:

```toml
[project]
name = "fastapi-health-app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "FastAPI application with health endpoint"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi[standard]",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest",
    "httpx",
    "pytest-mock",
]
```

## Verifying Application Functionality

After setting up the FastAPI application, verify its functionality using the following steps:

1. **Run tests to confirm code functionality**:
   ```bash
   uv run -m pytest -v
   ```
   
   This command will run all tests and display verbose output to confirm everything is working correctly.

2. **Run the application locally**:
   ```bash
   uv run -m uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
   Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to view the Swagger UI documentation and try out the health endpoint.
   
   You can check the health endpoint directly at http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

3. **Build and run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t fastapi-health-app .
   
   # Run the container
   docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-health-app
   ```
   
   Or using docker-compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   
   Verify the Docker deployment by accessing the same endpoints as above.

4. **Validation checklist**:
   - Health endpoint returns 200 OK with appropriate status information
   - Swagger documentation is accessible and correctly displays API endpoints
   - Tests pass with no failures or errors
   - Application starts without errors in both local and Docker environments

Following these verification steps ensures that your FastAPI application is functioning correctly in both development and containerized environments.
