# Steps to Scaffold a Simple FastAPI Application with Health Endpoint

Here are the steps I would take to scaffold a simple FastAPI application with a health endpoint, following best practices and the recommended folder structure from the FastAPI documentation:

1. **Create the basic folder structure**:
   ```
   app/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── main.py
   ├── routers/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── health.py
   └── core/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── config.py
   ```

2. **Set up the core configuration module** (`app/core/config.py`):
   - Define application settings
   - Set up environment variables handling
   - Configure logging

3. **Create the health router** (`app/routers/health.py`):
   - Import APIRouter from FastAPI
   - Define a health endpoint that returns status information
   - Include proper typing and status codes
   - Add informative docstrings

4. **Implement the main application** (`app/main.py`):
   - Import and configure the FastAPI application
   - Include the health router
   - Add application metadata (title, description, version)
   - Set up any global middleware or dependencies

5. **Create entry point** (`main.py` in the root directory):
   - Import the FastAPI app
   - Configure server settings for running the application
   - Add a conditional for running the app directly

6. **Add development tools**:
   - Requirements.txt or pyproject.toml for dependencies
   - .gitignore file
   - README.md with setup and usage instructions

7. **Set up testing structure**:
   - Create a tests directory
   - Add basic health endpoint tests

8. **Add Docker configuration** (optional):
   - Dockerfile for containerization
   - docker-compose.yml for local development

This approach follows the recommended FastAPI project structure with proper separation of concerns, making the application maintainable and scalable. The health endpoint serves as a simple way to verify the API is running correctly.
